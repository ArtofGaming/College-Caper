This fashion game uses MVC architecture to create a simple dress up game experience. The view layer is inside of Unity, and all the clothes are kept inside a catalogue database as well as a list of their attributes.

The meshes were made in Blender and are linked with the databse by names so that whenever a certain item is selected the model that shares its name has its mesh renderer enabled on the model.

The tabs on the side filter items by clothing category and only those are sortable in the application for now, but on the SQL side this is already possible.
